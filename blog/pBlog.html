                <p>How has this course changed your outlook on learning?
                    It hasn’t really. I’ve always been a better learner with hands on content, thats most of the reason
                    I
                    chose this course.
                    What’s changed? Why?

                <p>Austin Coding Academy Time sure is flying, its been three weeks already? I feel like I just started
                    the
                    course last week! While some of the data to absorb is a little confusing and sometimes stressing, I
                    know
                    I need to just stay the course and it’ll all make sense.

                    idiotic
                    minor details and not let them frustrate me!)
                    Love it with Austin Coding Academy and looking forward to the rest!
