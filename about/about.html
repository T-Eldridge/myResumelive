                <p>A drummer for the better part of my life. I started playing in elementary band and later played with Saint Solution for five years until other members were called away for other personal persuits.</p>

                <p>Becoming a Dad was a major turning point in my life, much like every parent. You go from putting your interests first, to doing everything you can to provide a healthy lifestyle for your children.</p>

                <p>I will always have a passion for cooking. I have held several positions at several different establishments, and honestly don't care much for the discconection from the customers and the cooks. As most the times cooks are just "under educated people who couldn't get a better job" therefore every time the food is wrong it's your fault, even if the customer doesn't know what in the world a medium steak actually is.</p>

                <img src="./../images/actor.jpg">
               <p>Much like drumming and cooking, I was bitten by the acting bug pretty early. Church plays, eventual stage plays beginning with The Secret Garden and being an upset 7yr old boy in tights. I have played many different roles since then, from comedic relief, to villainous dragon.</p>
